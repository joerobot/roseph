                    <h3>Where is it?</h3>
                    <p>The celebrations will be held at the <strong>Peckham Liberal Club</strong> on the <strong>10th March 2018</strong>. Parking is difficult so we suggest coming by public transport. The venue is really close Peckham Rye station which is well served by buses and trains (<a href="https://citymapper.com/go/72k7du" target="_blank">or you can click here for some help</a>). There are limited pay and display spaces on nearby Holly Grove.</p>

                    <h3>Stuff you should know</h3>
                    <h4>Drink</h4>
                    <p>There is a <strong>CASH ONLY</strong> bar at the venue! There is no cash machine in the building so it’ll be better to bring cash with you. There are some cashpoints very close on Rye Lane.</p>

                    <h4>Dress code</h4>
                    <p>There is no dress code. Be as snazzy or as casual as you fancy.</p>

                    <h4>Food</h4>
                    <p>We will have a buffet of vegetarian and vegan food, which will be a ‘bring and share’ affair - we’ll draw up a food list and nearer the time we’ll ask everybody to contribute something specific to the buffet to make sure we have a range of dishes. Please let us know if you’re not going to eat at the party, so we can work out how many people need feeding. Also, please inform us of any dietary requirements so we can cater for everyone.</p>

                    <h4>You're all great</h4>
                    <p>This wedding party is an amazing opportunity for us to have all of the people we love together in one space. We want everybody to feel comfortable and safe in this space, and if there is anything extra we can do to facilitate this, please let us know. Although we do need to know how many people are having food, please don’t feel any pressure to stay for the entire night. We will be super happy to see you, whether it’s for half an hour or the whole night.</p>
